# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Import numpy module to use built-in functions
### Step 2: Get lists from the linear equations and assign it to np.array
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula  
### Step 4: Print the result.
### Step 5: End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
a=[10,6]
b=[4,2]
dist=math.sqrt (((b[0]-a[0])**2)+((b[1]-a[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(dist))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
